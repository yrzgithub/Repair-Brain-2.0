## The Problem

    * The major problem in overcoming addictions or compulsions (physical or psychological) is forgetting our goal ie..To become independent.
    * Forgetting denies us from breaking the addiction cycle and it continues.
    * We didn't know whether we are progressing or not.
    * We fail to replace our addictive habits.

## How does this app help?

    * The app regularly tracks whether you are free or addicted.
    * It calculates how long you are free or how long you didn't repeat the behaviour.
    * Once you relapsed, The time starts from 0.
    * Positive effects, Side effects and Steps to overcome compulsions can be noted.

    * They can be edited in the same app.

    * As a reward, whenever you didn't relapse, A song or part of it starts playing.
    * To use a part of a song, search "<song name> or <favourite line> ringtone" in google.
    * This app tracks whether your are replacing your habits or not and shows habit replacing accuracy.
